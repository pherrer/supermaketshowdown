My game is a text-based game of chance. 
As the player, you will be guided through a perilous quest through the aisles of a supermarket and will have a chance against the monsters that lurk there.
You interact with the game through typing and “rolling” a dice. 
Each monster has a power level that you must overcome with your own power level (your own power level coming from the number you roll). 
If the number that you roll happens to be higher than the number of the monster’s power level, then you beat that monster and move onto the next. 
If not, your quest will come to an end. 
The ultimate goal of the game is to cross everything off of your shopping list, which will happen once you beat every monster

I made this game for a competition in my senior year of high school. It was orginally on replit but I moved it to github!
This project came from a love of text based rpg games and board games as well as wanting to find the fun in ordinary tasks, such as going to the supermarket.
