#NOTE: this was from when i was testing the game and i didn't end up using it in this game, however i am leaving it here because it was useful in general

#theStr = oglist
#substr = item from oglist

 
def remove_all(sublist,oglist):
   if sublist in oglist: #checks if apples is in theSTR
       news = oglist.replace(sublist, " ") #if it is, it gets removed
       print("items left: ",news)
   else: #aka if apples is NOT in theStr
       print(oglist)
